					In today's world, almost every business and individual has a website to showcase their products, services or
					ideas. But, have you ever wondered what a website is made of? A website is essentially a collection of files
					that are stored on a server and are accessed through the internet by a user. However, these files are not
					just simple text or image files; they are built using a combination of different languages and technologies,
					such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
					<br /><br />
					HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the backbone of any website. It is used to structure the content of a
					webpage and define its elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML provides a set of tags
					and attributes that developers use to build a webpage's layout and structure. In simpler terms, HTML is the
					language used to create the bones of a webpage, defining the different elements and how they are arranged.
					Think of it like the skeleton of a webpage, providing a structure for everything else to be built upon.
					<br /><br />
					CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to style and design a webpage. It defines the colors,
					fonts, and layout of a webpage, allowing developers to create visually appealing websites that are also
					user-friendly. CSS works in conjunction with HTML, providing the design elements that are applied to the
					structure created by HTML. It is like the skin and clothing of a webpage, defining how it looks and feels.
					<br /><br />
					<b>JavaScript</b>, on the other hand, is a scripting language that is used to make a website interactive and
					dynamic. It allows developers to create animations, effects, and functionality that enhances the user
					experience. JavaScript works in conjunction with HTML and CSS, adding the interactivity and functionality
					that makes a website come to life. It is like the muscles and nerves of a webpage, allowing it to respond
					and react to user input. <br /><br />
					In summary, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three essential languages used to build a website. HTML
					defines the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines its design and style, and JavaScript makes it
					interactive and dynamic. Together, these three languages work hand in hand to create the web pages that we
					use every day.
