					<p>
						Hey there. If you're thinking about whether or not to start coding, let me tell you, it's worth giving
						it a shot. While technology might not be your cup of tea, coding offers a plethora of benefits that go
						beyond just understanding tech. For starters, coding can improve your problem-solving skills and boost
						your creativity. It can also help you gain a deeper understanding of how things work and develop a
						logical thought process. Additionally, coding skills are highly sought after in many industries, so it
						can be a valuable asset to have on your resume. And who knows, you might even discover a passion for
						coding and tech along the way. So, give coding a chance and see where it takes you! <br /><br />
						Programming is an industry that is constantly evolving, with new career paths appearing every day that
						may suit you. It may seem daunting at first when you open an editor and freeze in front of all the
						options in front of you, but remember that everyone starts somewhere. The best way to maintain
						motivation in learing a programming language is think of something that you'd like to do, then learn how
						to do it.

				<img src="./images/card-3.svg" alt="Waves" />
				<p>
					HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it is the standard markup language used to create web pages.
					In simpler terms, HTML is the language that web developers use to create the content you see on websites.
					<br /><br />
					HTML consists of a series of elements, or tags, that are used to structure and display content on a web
					page. For example, a heading might be marked up with the <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> tag, while a paragraph of text
					might be marked up with the <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>.These tags tell your web browser how to display the content on
					the page. They might specify the font size and color of text, the placement of images and videos, or the
					layout of the page itself. <br /><br />
					Because HTML is an open standard, it is used by web developers all over the world to create websites that
					can be viewed by anyone with an internet connection. This means that no matter where you are in the world,
					you can access the same content on the web as anyone else.
					<br /><br />
					While HTML is just one of many programming languages used to create web pages, it is an essential one.
					Without HTML, web pages would not exist as we know them today. Whether you're reading this on a desktop
					computer, tablet, or smartphone, it's all thanks to the power of HTML.
					<br /><br />
					In conclusion, HTML is the language that web developers use to create the content you see on websites. It is
					made up of tags that tell your web browser how to display the content on the page, and it is used all over
					the world to create websites that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
